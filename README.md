# Portable-Power-Bank
Utilizing my expertise in power electronics, I engineered a portable power bank tailored to modern needs.The power bank boasts two output ports, catering to diverse requirements; not only can it illuminate 12V LEDs, but it also serves as a reliable charging hub for smartphones and other electronic devices.

What sets this innovation apart is its versatility in charging methods. By harnessing both traditional electricity and renewable solar energy, the power bank offers users the freedom to replenish its energy reserves anytime, anywhere. This dual-charging capability enhances its practicality, making it an ideal companion for outdoor adventures or emergency situations where access to power sources may be limited.
